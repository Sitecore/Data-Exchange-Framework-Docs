Install SDK
===================================================
The Data Exchange Framework SDK is an extension for 
Sitecore that automates steps that are needed in 
order to create, monitor and maintain custom providers.

The SDK is installed using a Sitecore installation 
package. This package must be installed on the 
Sitecore server you are using for your development.

The Data Exchange Framework SDK package is available 
for download on the `Sitecore Developer Portal <https://dev.sitecore.net/Downloads/Data_Exchange_Framework.aspx>`_.
