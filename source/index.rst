Welcome to the Data Exchange Framework Developer Guide. 
Data Exchange Framework is used to model processes that
synchronize data between multiple systems.

This documentation covers how the framework works, 
how to use it and how to extend it.

.. note::

    This guide assumes that you have installed Data 
    Exchange Framework on your Sitecore server. The 
    installation guide covers both of this requirement. 
    It is available on the Sitecore Developer Portal.
