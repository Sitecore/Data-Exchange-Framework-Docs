Configuration
---------------------------------------------------
The base *apply mapping rule* should not be used on 
its own. It is a base template for specific types of 
*apply mapping rules*.

.. seealso::
    
    For information on the *apply mapping rules* included 
    with the supported providers, see the section 
    :doc:`/component-reference/apply-mapping-rules/index` 
    in the :doc:`/component-reference/index`.

When to Extend
---------------------------------------------------
Data Exchange Framework comes with a set of standard 
*apply mapping rules*. In addition, each provider 
may include a set of *apply mapping rules* designed 
specifically for the system the provider integrates.

Custom *apply mapping rules* can be implemented 
in cases where special logic is needed in order 
to determine whether a *value mapping* should 
be applied.
