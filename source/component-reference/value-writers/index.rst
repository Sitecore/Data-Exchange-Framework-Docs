Value Writers
===================================================
A value writer is like a property setter in .NET. It 
provides the ability to write a value to an object. 
Out-of-the-box, Data Exchange Framework includes a 
number of value writers that can be used to 
configure various aspects of a sync process.

This section describes the value writers that are 
included with Data Exchange Framework and the 
providers that are supported by Sitecore.
