Value Accessors
===================================================
A value accessor is like a property in .NET. It represents 
a value that can be read and/or written. Out-of-the-box, 
Data Exchange Framework includes a number of value 
accessors that can be used to configure data mapping, 
along with various aspects of the sync process.

This section describes the value accessors that 
are included with Data Exchange Framework and 
the providers that are supported by Sitecore.
