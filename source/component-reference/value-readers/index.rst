Value Readers
===================================================
A value reader is like a property getter in .NET.
It provides the ability to get a value from an object.
Out-of-the-box, Data Exchange Framework includes a 
number of value readers that can be used to configure
various aspects of a sync process.

This section describes the value readers that are 
included with Data Exchange Framework and the
providers that are supported by Sitecore.
