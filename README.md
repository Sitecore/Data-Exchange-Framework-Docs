# Data Exchange Framework Documentation

This project provides documentation for Data Exchange Framework for Sitecore.

## Building the documentation

In order to use the documentation, you must build it. 

Detailed instructions are available on the [ASP.NET Core documentation site](https://github.com/aspnet/Docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

> If you are writing documentation, running in 
> [livehtml](https://github.com/aspnet/Docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#use-autobuild-to-easily-view-site-changes-locally) mode makes it very easy to preview 
> your changes.
