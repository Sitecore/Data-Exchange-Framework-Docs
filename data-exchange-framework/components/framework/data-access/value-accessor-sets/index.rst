Value Accessor Sets
=======================

A *value accessor set* groups a number of related *value accessors*.

A value accessor set is used to model an object that can serve as a 
*source object* or a *target object*.

For example, when you want to read a contact from CRM, you must 
identify the attributes you want to read. Each attribute is
represented using a value accessor. The collection of all of the 
attributes you want to read is represented by a value accessor set.
