Empty Data Exchange Tenant
==========================================

This branch template creates a new *tenant*, and ensures that the 
folder structure under the tenant includes all of the items that
are required for most tenants.

.. hint:: 

    Often, a provider will include its own branch template for 
    creating a tenant that is pre-configured with synchronization 
    settings that are appropriate for the systems that the provider 
    supports.
