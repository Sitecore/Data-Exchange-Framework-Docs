Mappings Applied Action Rules
==============================================

Before a *mappings applied action* runs, certain conditions 
must be met. For example, you may only want to update the
status of an entry in a work queue if the entry currently 
has a specific value.

A *mappings applied action rule* is used to configuree 
these conditions.
