Configure Pipeline to Resolve Source Object
=================================================

A synchronization process always involves a *source object* 
(the object from which values are read) and a *target object* 
(the object to which the values that were read are written).

In this example, the *target object* is a Sitecore item. The 
*source object* does not matter. This step assumes that you 
already have a pipeline configured that resolves the 
*source object*.
