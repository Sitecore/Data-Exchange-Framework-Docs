Schedule a Pipeline Batch
============================

Dynamics CRM Connect includes commands that can be run using Sitecore's task
scheduling features.

Tasks can be scheduled using Content Editor, under the item
**sitecore > system > Tasks > Schedules**. When you configure
a task you must select a command. The command describes what
should happen when the task runs.

When you install Data Exchange Framework, a folder is created at
**sitecore > system > Tasks > Commands > Data Exchange**. This 
is where the commands that control synchronization processes
are stored.

For more information on the templateS used to schedule pipeline batches,
see :doc:`../../components/framework/sitecore-task-commands/index`.
