Create Source File
===========================================================

The source file contains information about cities. Each row in the file
represents a different city. The first line in the file contains the
names of the columns in the file.

1. Create a new file ``c:\Sitecore\cities.dat``.

    .. hint:: 
    
        You may place this file whever you want, but it must be 
        accessible from your Sitecore server.
 
2. Add the following text to the file:

    .. code-block:: text
    
        id,country,city
        fr1,France,Paris
        dk1,Denmark,Copenhagen
        jp1,Japan,Tokyo
        us1,United States,New York
        us2,United States,Los Angeles

3. Save the file.
