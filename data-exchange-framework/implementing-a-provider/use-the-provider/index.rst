Use the Provider
=======================================

This section covers how to configure a *pipeline batch* that uses the
file system provider to create and populate Sitecore items from the 
contents of a text file.

For this example, you will create a file that contains information about 
different cities. Each row in the file represents a single city. Each
city will be represented in Sitecore as an item. 

The synchronization process will read the cities from the file and 
create Sitecore items for each. If a Sitecore item already exists
for a city in the file, the Sitecore item will be updated with the
information from the file.
