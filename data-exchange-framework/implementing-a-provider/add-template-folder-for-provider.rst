Add Template Folder for Provider
=======================================

All of the templates for a provider should be grouped together.
It makes it easier to distribute the provider in the future when
all of the templates are in the same path.

Since you are creating a new provider, a new template folder is 
needed.

1. In Sitecore, open Template Manager.
2. Navigate to **Templates > Data Exchange > Providers**.
3. Add a template folder named **File System**.
