Define Requirements
=======================================

The first thing you must do is define the requirements for your provider.

This provider reads data from a file. The following user stories will be
implemented:

1. As a content editor **I can specify a file to read** from so that I can 
   control which data is read. 
2. As a content editor **I can specify whether or not the file contains** 
   **a header row** so that the provider does not impose constraints on the
   files it can read.
3. As a content editor **I can specify a limit to the number of rows to**
   **read from the file** so that I can control the data that is read.
