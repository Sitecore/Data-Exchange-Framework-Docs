Endpoint
=======================================

An *endpoint* represents a data source. The endpoint may support 
the ability to read data, to write data, or to both read and 
write data.

Examples of endpoints are:

    * URL for a web service used to read data from a CRM
    * Path to a directory used to read files
    * Connection string used to connect to a relational database
