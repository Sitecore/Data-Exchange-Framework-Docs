Provider
=======================================

A *provider* is a connector for Data Exchange Framework. It includes all
of the components needed in order to incorporate data from a system into
synchronization processes.

A provider typically includes:

    * Sitecore templates used to configure synchronization processes
    * *Plugins* that accomodate settings that are unique to the system 
      being integrated
    * *Pipeline steps* that provide the ability to interact with the 
      system being integrated
    * *Converters* that transform the Sitecore items based on the 
      provider templates into framework components
