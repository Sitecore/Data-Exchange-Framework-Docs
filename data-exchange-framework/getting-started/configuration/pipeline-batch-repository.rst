Pipeline Batch Repository
=======================================

A *pipeline batch repository* is a component used to read 
*pipeline batch* objects from a Sitecore server. This component
is used when you want to run a synchronization process. It 
provides access to the pipeline batches that you can run.

.. hint:: 

    Unless you are writing an application that runs outside of 
    the Sitecore server, it is unlike you will need to use this
    component.

.. hint:: 

    Data Exchange Framework comes with a default pipeline batch
    repository. It is unlikely you will need to extend this type
    or to build your own.
