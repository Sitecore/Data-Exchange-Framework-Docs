Value Accessor Set
=======================================

A *value accessor set* is a collection of *value accessor* objects.

An example of a value accessor set is a collection of value accessors
used to read or write a Sitecore item that represents a product. 

.. hint:: 

    A value accessor set is like a .NET class. A value accessor is 
    like a .NET property. A value reader is like a property getter. 
    A value writer is like a property setter. 

.. note::

    Data Exchange Framework includes a default value accessor set.
    More information on this component is available in the
    :doc:`../../components/index` section, under 
    :doc:`../../components/framework/data-access/value-accessor-sets/value-accessor-set`.

.. hint::

    If you are developing a custom provider, it is likely you will 
    develop custom value accessor sets.
