Value Accessor Set
=======================================

A *value accessor set* is a collection of *value accessor* objects.

An example of a value accessor set is a collection of value accessors
used to read or write a Sitecore item that represents a product. 

.. hint::

    Data Exchange Framework includes a default value accessor set. 
    In most cases, this value accessor set will be sufficient for 
    any value accessor set you configure. It is unlikely that you
    will need to extend the default value accessor set, or to 
    implement your own.
