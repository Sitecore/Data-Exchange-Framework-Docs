Value Reader
=======================================

A *value reader* is a component that is able to read a value
from an object. 

Data Exchange Framework includes a number of value readers. 
In addition, custom value readers can be created by implementing 
the ``Sitecore.DataExchange.DataAccess.IValueReader`` interface.
