Value Writer
=======================================

A *value writer* is a component that is able to write a value
to an object. 

Data Exchange Framework includes a number of value writers. 
In addition, custom value writers can be created by implementing 
the ``Sitecore.DataExchange.DataAccess.IValueWriter`` interface.
